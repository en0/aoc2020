# Advent of Code
This is a list of my solutions for
[AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/)

## Quickstart

If you want to run this code locally, you will need to install the package and run the challenge using the `aoc` commandline tool.

To install:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

To run:
```bash
aoc 1 1
```

For more information:
```bash
aoc -h
```
